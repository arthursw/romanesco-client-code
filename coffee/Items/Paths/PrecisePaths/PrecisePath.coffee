define ['Path'], (Path) ->

	# PrecisePath extends R.RPath to add precise editing functionalities
	# PrecisePath adds control handles to the control path (which can be hidden):
	# one can edit, add or remove points, to precisely shape the curve.
	# The user can edit the curve with the 'Edit Curve' folder of the gui

	# Points of a PrecisePath can have three states:
	# - smooth (default): the handles of the point are always aligned, they are not necessarly of the same size (although they are equal if the user presses the shift key)
	# - corner: the handles of the point are independent, giving the possibility to make sharp corners
	# - point: the point has no handles, it is simple to manipulate

	# A precise path has two modes:
	# - the default mode: handles are editable
	# - the smooth mode: handles are not editable and the control path is [smoothed](http://paperjs.org/reference/path/#smooth)

	# A precise path has two creation modes:
	# - the default mode: a point is added to the control path when the user drags the mouse (at each drag event), resulting in many close points
	# - the polygon mode: a point is added to the control path when the user clicks the mouse, and the last handle is modified when the user drags the mouse

	# # The drawing

	# The drawing is performed as follows:
	# - the control path is divided into a number of steps of fixed size (giving points along the control path at regular intervals)
	# - the drawing is updated at each of those points
	# - to have better results, the remaining step (which is shorter) is split in half and distributed among the first and last step
	# - the size of the steps is data.step, and can be added in the gui
	# - during the drawing process, the *offset* property corresponds to the current position along the control path where the drawing must be updated
	#   (offset can be seen as the length of the drawing along the path)

	# For example the simplest precise path is as a set of points regularly distributed along the control path;
	# a more complexe precise path would also be function of the normal and the tangent of the control point at each point.

	# The drawing is performed with three methods:
	# - beginDraw() called to initialize the drawing,
	# - updateDraw() called at each update,
	# - endDraw() called at the end of the drawing.

	# There are two cases where precise path is created:
	# - when the user creates the path with the mouse:
	#     - each time a new P.Point is added to the control path:
	#       updateDraw() is called to continue the drawing along the control path until *offset* (the length of the drawing) equals the control path length (minus the remaining step)
	#       this process takes place in {PrecisePath#checkUpdateDrawing} (it is overridden by {SpeedPath#checkUpdateDrawing})
	#       it is part of the beginCreate/Update/End() process
	# - when the path is loaded (or when the control path exists):
	#     - the remaining step (which is shorter) is split in half and distributed among the first and last step
	#     - updateDraw() is called in a loop to draw the whole drawing along the control path at once, in {PrecisePath#draw}
